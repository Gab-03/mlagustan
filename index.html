                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I’m a Data Scientist and researcher specializing in social computing models and health risk mapping. With a strong foundation in data science and analytics, I am deeply passionate about leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and time series analysis to drive impactful contributions to public health and disease surveillance. My work focuses on integrating data-driven insights with innovative modeling approaches to address complex health challenges, particularly in understanding and predicting disease patterns.
                
                <br><br>
                I recently completed my Master’s in Computer Science at Ateneo de Manila University, and Bachelor's where I graduated Magna Cum Laude. My academic journey has equipped me with a robust understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of data science, enabling me to effectively analyze and interpret large datasets. I thrive on transforming raw data into actionable insights that can inform public health strategies and improve community well-being.
                <br><br>
                I had the honor of presenting my research paper at the 2024 International Conference on Social Computing, Behavioral-Cultural Modeling, and Prediction held at Carnegie Mellon University. This experience allowed me to share my findings with a global audience and engage with fellow researchers in meaningful discussions. For more details about the conference, you can visit SBP-BRiMS 2024.
